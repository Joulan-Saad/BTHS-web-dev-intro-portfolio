<!--
    Just some notes
    
    wizard:
1 - Typical Flaw: Physically weak
2 - Typical Strength: Usually the definition of Big Brain Time
3 - Knows an absurd amount of spells
4 - Best suited for ranged support
5 - Can specialize in a specific school of spells to make them more effective
6 - Doesn't really rely on equipment to be more effective as they level up

rogue
1 - Typical Flaw: Not very wise and is often involved in more shady business
2 - Typical Strength: A mastery of deception and stealth
3 - Can be a great surprise when necessary
4 - Best suited for missions requiring subtlety
5 - Is excellent at setting ambushes 
6 - Doesn't rely much on equipment but it can help

fighter
1 - Typical Flaw: Not usually much help in scenarios that don't require physical strength
2 - Typical Strength: Excels in physical combat
3 - Is an excellent and reliable damage dealing front line
4 - Very versatile choice of weaponry 
5 - Rarely outmatched in physical combat
6 - Can manage without equipment but benefits greatly from higher tier armor and weapons

barbarian
1 - Typical Flaw: Not usually much help in scenarios that don't require physical strength and is prone to rage
2 - Typical Strength: Can be even tougher than the fighter
3 - Can tank just about everything
4 - Can use most melee weapons but prefers the biggest and heaviest weaponry
5 - Who needs a wall or defense when you've got this guy?
6 - Uses heavy weapons. What about armor you ask? No need, his skin is tougher than most armor. 

cleric
1 - Typical Flaw: Dedicated to the code of their God, almost unreasonably so
2 - Typical Strength: Their faith turns them into a force to be reckoned with. Clerics typically have the strength of a Fighter as well as the spellcasting ability of a Wizard alongside their own healing capabilities
3 - Is incredibly versatile
4 - Usually the best healer
5 - Typically has the best "good" view point on matters
6 - Doesn't need much equipment like the wizard, but can benefit greatly like the fighter

bard
1 - Typical Flaw: Flirts a bit too much or is a bit too carefree
2 - Typical Strength: Has the most creative approach to most situations
3 - They can sing, dance, paint, prance, make a pretty dirt drawing with a lance, Plenty of ways to further enhance the battlefield if given the right chance
4 - Has a silver tongue and can navigate conversational waters like an experienced sailor
5 - Isn't usually as physically tough as a cleric but is just as versatile
6 - Doesn't need much in the way of equipment aside from their art/music equipment
