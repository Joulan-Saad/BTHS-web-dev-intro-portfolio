<!--
to do list:
Fix the craft buttons so that you can't craft into the negative values.    Update: should be fixed
Fix restart button so that the tom and jerry left side pic shows up.     Update: Should be fixed
Fix the update log command so that restarting does not delete the info parts of it when no rounds have happened.    Update: Should be fixed
Fix bug that lets you craft into the negative when only one material is at 0

		<h1>Xtreme Rock Paper Scissors!</h1>
		<div>Rules: To play this game, you only need to know 6 things:</div>
		<div>1: You need to know how to play rock paper scissors. The gist of it is that you and another pplayer use your fingers to create the shape of either a rock paper or scissor at the same time that your opponent does. Whoever creates the weapon that beats the other one wins.</div>
		<div>2: The available weapons are rock, paper, and scissors.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock</div>
		<div>3: In this version of XTREME rock paper scissors, you have to play a little bit differently. In the regular game, you can play any weapon at any time with no consequence (besides losing of course). In this version, you only have 5 of each weapon to start with, and if you lose the match, you lose that weapon.</div>
		<div>4: If you use a weapon 3 times in a row, you can no longer use that weapon</div>
		<div>5: If you win however, you get to take your opponents weapons and use them against them, thus increasing your own arsenal</div>
		<div>6: To win, you need to rid your opponent of all of their weapons. Alternatively, if your opponenet has only one type of weapon left, you automatically win because your opponent cannot win with only a single type of weapon.</div>
